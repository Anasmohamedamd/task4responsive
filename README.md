## Responsive Design for Mobile Layout

 **Overview**
Responsive design ensures that your website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes—desktop, tablet, or mobile—improving usability and user experience.

**Steps to Make Your Website Responsive**

1. Open the HTML page in VS Code
   Start by opening your project files in Visual Studio Code.
   
2. Identify fixed-width elements or large images
   Look for elements with fixed widths (px) or images that may overflow on smaller screens.
   
3. Write media queries targeting max-width 768px
   Apply CSS rules for tablets and mobile devices

4. Adjust layout
* Stack columns vertically.
* Reduce font sizes for better readability.

5. Make navigation responsive
* Collapse the nav menu into a hamburger icon on smaller screens.
* Stack navigation links vertically.

6. Test with Chrome DevTools device toolbar
* Open DevTools → Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M).
* Test different screen widths and orientations.

7. Fix overflow and scrolling issues
   Ensure no elements overflow horizontally or cause unwanted scrolling.

8. Ensure images scale within containers
   Use responsive image properties
